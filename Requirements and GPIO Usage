*** Requirements ***
- 4 LEDs (4 different colors)
- 4 buttons
- 1 buzzer
- Lots of jumper wire (at least 11 female-to-male wires)
- 9 resistors (four 1K Ohm and five 330 Ohm)

*** GPIO Ports (Using GPIO.BCM organization) ***
- GPIO2 for Buzzer
- 3.3V rail for the buttons (using pull-up resistors)
- GPIO18, GPIO24, GPIO8 and GPIO12 for button inputs
- GPIO17, GPIO10, GPIO11 and GPIO6 for LED outputs
- A random ground port
